# Better Recognition

For those of us who have been trying to achieve recognition in Victoria v1.7 as a major unrecognised nation, the extremely punishing GDP per capita and SOL requirements can make this effort nigh impossible. Couple that with the sometimes bugged wargoal enforcement (have you ever won wars with Russia to the point that they're a rump state west of the Urals, only to gain no recognition?) and the extremely opaque UI, recognition has been more frustrating than ever.

No more, I say, as strong unrecognized powers should be able to achieve recognition simply by being strong, not by having some pseudo-HDI number checked by a powerful Victorian computer. However, the existing negative progress markers for being a backwards, slave-owning nation still exist, so earning recognition through economic power alone will still be difficult; it's just no longer impossible.

Changes:

- Having a GDP of over 100 million will gain +1 progress point per month
- Having a prestige in the top 10 will gain +1 progress point per month
- The "Earning Recognition" journal entry now tells you where your recognition points are going

This mod is very lightweight and only modifies the following files:

- 05_request_recognition.txt

In addition, this mod replaces the following strings:

- je_earn_recognition_reason
- je_earn_recognition_advance
- je_earn_recognition_deplete
